# A600KB-PCBMembrane old A600BlueKBMembranetoPCB

Replace your A600 blue and (now) green keyboard membrane using PCB. Yeah for the A600, the Amiga that it seems no one want to recreate.. :(( I love my tiny A600 machine.

#### Fully reverse engineered from an original blue membrane by @edu_arana in 2019.

# Note

This is a work in progress, several testing has been made but it should work as is. I take no responsibiltiy for any damage to any equipment that results from the use of this board. 

#### USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!

# Updates

18/08/2021: Uploaded gerbers compatible with blue and green membranes. (if you produce them, its at your own, have not tested the green one).

12/11/2019: Updated license stuff (I usually not do this but I must start it with this).

30/09/2019: Initial release.

# A little of history

It all start by the necessity... my first A600 fully modded with Vampire 600 start to fail on the keyboard, some keys were non working and after some time the entire kb stop working. So I search for a membrane replacement. When I found one and saw the price of it, it does not convence me at all, because with time It will fail again. So I decide to fix this by using a replacement made on PCB. I saw that Kipper2k publish some pics of something like this too but there was no chance to get one on that moment. So since I already have experience recreating keyboards (I have made a C64 mechanical keyboard too), I was accustomed to the "matrix" solution too.

My A600 https://arananet-net.kinja.com/instalacion-interna-de-un-plipbox-internet-en-mi-comm-1784934347
and https://arananet-net.kinja.com/instalacion-de-la-aceleradora-vampire-v2-en-mi-a600-c-1782458393.

So after some trials and errors (more errors than trials) I finally fix all the errors, and make two boards, one boards its the keyboard pcb itself and the other is a tiny pcb that is used to plug into the A600 motherboard connector. The connection between the two board is made by a FFC/FPC flat 0.5mm cable.

#### AMIGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!.
